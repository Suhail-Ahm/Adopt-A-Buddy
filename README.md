# HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge: Adopt a buddy

### PROBLEM OVERVIEW

It is a multi-class classification problem. It is a supervised learning problem in which our task is to train our model with labeled dataset and predict the two target attributes:
1. breed_category(Breed category of the pet)
2. pet_category(Category of the pet target variable)
